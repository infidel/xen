* os.h bit manipulation, write optimized assembly code
* support abort exception handling ( and others )
* scheduling!
* use proper memory types and enable caches (L1 and L2)
* Use LDREX and STREX in xchg implementation ( code already there but it causes an abort, I think because of using strong-ordered memory with disabled L1 caches - something to do with the implementation of the monitor on cortex-a7 )
* gic request_irq implementation, currently all IRQs all hardcoded in gic irq handler.
* use device tree instead of the currently hardcoded values
* Add virtual memory support and make vstart = 0 ( use 4k descriptors instead of 1M descriptors )
* sched
* fini_gnttab
* fini_time
* bind_*
* add multiple cpu support (?)
* map_frames
* clean up the code and remove redundent code between arm and x86
* make sure that wallclock is functioning properly
* evtchn_get_peercontext
